# What is a Cluster?

A computing cluster is a set of many computers networked together. Because there are many computers working together, the network is able to handle computationally expensive tasks, like genome assemblies or advanced algorithms. Imagine you're building a house. It would take a long time by yourself! It's much better to have many builders working together.

Now that we have a team of workers, the next challenge is task management. A home construction team will need a manager to help delegate tasks. Similarly, the computing cluster uses management software to prioritize tasks, delegate workers (resources), and check on progress. The Fred Hutch cluster uses a common management and scheduling tool called [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html).

How is the cluster different from a laptop or desktop? First, you might use an operating system like Windows or MacOS. The Fred Hutch server is a Linux system. Second, because many people use the cluster for many tasks, there isn't a central screen and keyboard. You access the cluster remotely from your computer! We will talk more about how to connect to the cluster in a [following chapter](#terminal).

# Account Setup

You will need an account to log in to the cluster.

## Check your HutchNet ID

A [HutchNet ID](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/center-it/help-desk.html) is the standard login you receive when you start working at the Hutch or are an official affiliate. You can use it to login to most resources at the Center (Desktop Computer, Employee Self Service, VPN, Webmail) and our Scientific Computing systems. 

For example:  

- my email is `jsmith3@fredhutch.org`.  
- my HutchNet ID is `jsmith3`.  

<div class = "notice">
If one of your collaborators requires access to the Fred Hutch network you can submit a [non-employee action form](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/f/hr/lcex/non-employee-action-form.html). Non-employees is a generic administrative term for affiliates, students, contractors, etc.

## Contacting SciComp

To use Scientific Computing clusters at Hutch, your HutchNet ID must be associated with a PI account. Please fill out [this Account Setup Form](https://forms.gle/5ct8mQCeBD7LUt6S7) and we will ensure you are set up correctly!

<div class = "warning">
We try to set users up ahead of time if we suspect they will need to use the cluster. However, not everyone is set up automatically. Errors similar to “Invalid account or account/partition” typically indicate that this association hasn’t been set up. This is a quick fix if you use the form above.
