# About this Course {-}

Our goal is to get you running on the Fred Hutch cluster quickly and efficiently with this quick-start guide. As a wise Drivers' Ed instructor once said, **you need to go slow to go fast**! 

In this short course, you'll invest a bit of time now to save you time and frustration down the road. Follow along at **any time on your own schedule**. We hope that the following modules will help you take advantage of the powerful resources the Fred Hutch has to offer!

<!-- we would rather folks waste computing resources than not use it at all! -->
