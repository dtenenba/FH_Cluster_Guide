As a wise Drivers’ Ed instructor once said, you need to go slow to go fast! In this short course, you’ll invest a bit of time now to save you time and frustration down the road. Follow along at any time on your own schedule. We hope that the following modules will help you take advantage of the powerful resources the Fred Hutch has to offer!

"],["account-setup.html", "Chapter 2 Account Setup 2.1 Check your HutchNet ID 2.2 Contacting SciComp", " Chapter 2 Account Setup You will need an account to log in to the cluster. 2.1 Check your HutchNet ID A HutchNet ID is the standard login you receive when you start working at the Hutch or are an official affiliate. You can use it to login to most resources at the Center (Desktop Computer, Employee Self Service, VPN, Webmail) and our Scientific Computing systems. For example: my email is jsmith3@fredhutch.org. my HutchNet ID is jsmith3. If one of your collaborators requires access to the Fred Hutch network you can submit a non-employee action form. Non-employees is a generic administrative term for affiliates, students, contractors, etc. 2.2 Contacting SciComp To use Scientific Computing clusters at Hutch, your HutchNet ID must be associated with a PI account. Please fill out this Account Setup Form and we will ensure you are set up correctly! We try to set users up ahead of time if we suspect they will need to use the cluster. However, not everyone is set up automatically. Errors similar to “Invalid account or account/partition” typically indicate that this association hasn’t been set up. This is a quick fix if you use the form above. Now, let’s set up our Terminal!
