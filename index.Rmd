# About this Course {-}

Fred Hutch maintains a high performance computing cluster specifically to support research work that requires more intensive computing than your average desktop computer can handle.

Our goal for this course is to get you running on the Fred Hutch cluster **quickly and efficiently**. This course is intended for anyone who may benefit from using the cluster, as well as staff new to the Hutch who may have used a cluster at another institution. We hope that the following modules will help you take advantage of the powerful resources the Fred Hutch has to offer!

The Fred Hutch cluster is supported by a group in IT called Scientific Computing, and this course was developed by the Fred Hutch Data Science Lab in collaboration with them. Please see the [author credits](#about-the-authors) for more information.
